"Participated in the AutoCAD 2D Workshop 2024, where I gained hands-on experience in creating precise 2D drawings and technical designs. Through this workshop,
I developed strong skills in drafting, editing, and annotating plans while learning best practices for professional CAD workflows. This experience enhanced my
technical proficiency and problem-solving abilities, preparing me to contribute effectively to design and engineering projects."
